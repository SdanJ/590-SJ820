                               CHAPTER I

                            TOM HAS AN IDEA


“Want to buy an automobile, son?”

Tom Benton smiled and shook his head.

“All right,” pursued the man good-naturedly. “I saw you looking at it,
and I didn’t know but you might be wanting a good car. She’s a bargain.”

“Sort of――worn out, isn’t it?” asked Tom, moving around to a new point
of view.

“N-no, there’s life in her yet, I guess. ’Course she needs overhauling,
as you might say, and some paint. But she’s got four whole cylinders, a
good set of gears an’――an’ some other things. No, she ain’t as bad as
she looks. If you hear of anyone looking for a bargain in a five-seat,
twenty-two-horsepower automobile, you tell ’em to come and see me, son.”

“What do you want for her?” asked Tom.

The carriage dealer looked at him shrewdly, kicked one worn and
tattered tire as if to satisfy himself that it wouldn’t come to pieces,
and replied: “A hundred and fifty dollars takes her just as she stands,
with top, side curtains, top cover an’――an’ I think there’s a jack
under the hind seat.”

“I dare say that’s reasonable,” replied Tom doubtfully, “but I guess it
would take a lot to put that car in running shape, wouldn’t it?”

The dealer shrugged his shoulders. “I reckon fifty dollars would make
a new car out of her, son. A coat of paint would make a whole pile
of difference in her looks, anyway, and I’d paint her and varnish
her for――let me see now; well, for thirty dollars. And that’s twenty
dollars cheaper than anyone else would do it for. Better think it over.”

“I’m afraid I couldn’t buy her,” laughed Tom. “I haven’t got that much
money.”

“Well, I didn’t suppose you had, but maybe your father would buy it for
you. Ain’t you John Benton’s son? Ain’t Postmaster Benton your daddy?”

“Yes, sir, but I guess he isn’t buying automobiles just now. If I hear
of anyone wanting one, though, I’ll tell them about this one. Want me
to help you run it inside?”

“Yes, you might take a wheel over there. Wait till I put the brake off.
Now, then! Heave-o! That’s the ticket. Easy! Look out for them hubs
on that surrey. All right. Much obliged to you. Tell you what I’ll
do, son; if you send a buyer for her, I’ll make you a present of ten
dollars. That’s fair, eh? You tell folks she’s a bargain. She is, too.
I reckon I could get three hundred for her in the city. I took her in
trade from a man over to Graywich. Why, that car cost thirteen hundred
dollars when she was new!”

“I guess that was a long time ago, wasn’t it?” hazarded Tom.
